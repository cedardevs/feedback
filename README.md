# Leaving us feedback

This is a public repository to leave us feedback on any of our projects. If you have any comments, questions, or have found any bugs and aren't sure how else to let us know, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/cedardevs/feedback/issues/new/choose).

Our primary projects are [OneStop](https://github.com/cedardevs/onestop) and Inventory Manager. Please be specific about which project you're discussing.

When leaving feedback, please be aware that the latest version of the code base can be interacted with on our development site at https://sciapps.colorado.edu/onestop/. Any bugs/features you may find in production could already be resolved in development, so please test against our in-development code before opening a new issue.

In addition to bug reports, we will use feedback to prioritize future features.
